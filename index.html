        Mecca is the birthplace of Muhammad.
        The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur ("Mountain of Light") is just outside the city and is where Muslims believe
        the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad.
        Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims.
        The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been
        built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims
        (qibla), cementing Mecca's significance in Islam.
